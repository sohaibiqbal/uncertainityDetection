Transformers based Implementation 


• Identify and classify uncertain information related to COVID-19 on Twitter using a Transformers-based Neural Network, a powerful deep learning model effective in capturing complex contextual dependencies.

• Preprocess the COVID-19 Twitter dataset by tokenizing, removing stop words, and handling special characters and emojis, similar to the LSTM approach.

• Feed the preprocessed data into the Transformers-based Neural Network, which consists of an input layer, transformer layers, and an output layer.

• The input layer converts the preprocessed tweet text into a numeric representation using word embeddings.

• The transformer layers process the sequential data, leveraging attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information among words effectively.

• Train the Transformers-based Neural Network using labeled examples of tweets indicating uncertainty and certainty, similar to the LSTM model.

• The model learns intricate patterns in the text, including contextual nuances, through backpropagation and attention mechanisms, enabling it to better understand and predict uncertainty labels.
