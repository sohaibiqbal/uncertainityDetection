•	Identify and classify uncertain information related to COVID-19 on Twitter using LSTM, a type of deep learning model effective in capturing dependencies.

•	Preprocess the COVID-19 Twitter dataset by tokenizing, removing stop words, and handling special characters and emojis.

•	Feed the preprocessed data into the LSTM model, which consists of an input layer, LSTM layer, and output layer.

•	The input layer converts the preprocessed tweet text into a numeric representation.

•	The LSTM layer processes the sequential data, capturing contextual information and dependencies among words.

•	Train the LSTM model using labeled examples of tweets indicating uncertainty and certainty.

•	The model learns to associate specific patterns in the text with uncertainty labels through backpropagation.

•	Adjust the model's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and true uncertainty labels.

•	Once trained, use the LSTM model to predict uncertainty in unseen tweets.

•	The model takes preprocessed text as input and outputs a probability score indicating the level of uncertainty.

•	Set a threshold to classify tweets as uncertain or certain based on the probability score.

•	Leveraging LSTM and deep learning techniques enhances the efficiency and accuracy of uncertainty detection in COVID-19 Twitter datasets.

•	Researchers and organizations can effectively analyze public sentiments and misinformation surrounding the pandemic.
